* all figure names should be formatted like `fig_something.png`
  * make sure all output figures are PNG
* shaded regions for baseline and drug
* multiply by 100 (and change axis labels)
* auto-scaling vertically
* maybe making more reliable output format
* low priority but... could the filename contain the timestamp in the format "1496177188.765.tif" ?
