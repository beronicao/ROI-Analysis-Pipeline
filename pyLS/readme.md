# pyLineScan
pyLineScan is a Python module intended to make it easy to access, analyze, and display data from PrairieView linescan folders. When the`LineScan` class is initialized with a path to a linescan folder, it automatically scans the folder for linescan images and reads the XML and ENV files to determine their framerate. Vertically-averaged traces of red, green, and delta(green/red) are immediately available. Plotting functions exist as well to rapidly visualize the experiment performed. These scripts are a sandbox of experimental code maintained by Scott Harden.
